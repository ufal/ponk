PONK is an on-line tool and REST API service for analyzing readability of Czech legal texts.
Taking a text as input (e.g., a letter sent by an administrative authority to a citizen), it runs external services for dependency parsing and named entity recognition
and then identifies and highlights low-readability parts in the text.
